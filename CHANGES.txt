v1.3 (2003-05-30)

  * Setting a cookie with ZopeTree is optional now. Simply pass
    set_cookie=0 to the ZopeTree constructor.

  * Fixed a security hole in the tree state decompressing
    mechanism. Previous versions were vulnerable to a denial of
    service attack using large tree states. Thanks go to Jamie Heilman
    for reporting the bug and Toby Dickenson for providing a fix.

v1.2 (2003-04-30)

  * Added optional 'expanded_nodes' argument to ZopeTree constructor.
    Thanks to Jean Jordaan for suggesting this.

  * Changed signature of TreeObjectWrapper constructor. 'path' is an
    optional argument now.

  * Added collapse() method to ZopeTree.Node.

v1.1 (2003-03-17)

  * It now works on Zope 2.4.

  * The unit test was not converted from RevisionManager yet. Fixed.
